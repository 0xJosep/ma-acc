            Morocco is renowned for its <span className="font-semibold">strategic position</span> between Europe and Africa, its <span className="font-semibold">rich cultural heritage</span>, and its <span className="font-semibold">exceptional human capital</span>. But Morocco is not yet known for fully capitalizing on these extraordinary advantages.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The reality is stark: while Morocco produces <span className="font-semibold">world-class talent</span> in engineering, science, and business, many of these brilliant minds end up contributing to the growth of other nations. Our country isn't just a bridge between continents; it's a powerhouse of potential that's waiting to be unleashed. Yet we've become comfortable with being known as just a <span className="font-semibold">"beautiful tourist destination"</span> or a <span className="font-semibold">"gateway to Africa"</span> rather than an innovation hub in our own right.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Look at the facts: Morocco has already demonstrated its capability for ambitious projects - from the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world to Africa's first high-speed rail network. We're not lacking in vision or ability; what we need is a fundamental shift in how we approach progress and innovation.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To transform this reality, we need to create an environment where innovators can thrive within Morocco. If we want the inherent creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of our people to build Morocco's future rather than enriching other nations, we must address the core challenges head-on. The talent, the vision, and the potential are all here - now it's time to accelerate.

            What's holding us back?
          </h2>
          
          <p>
            The barriers we face aren't in our capabilities - they're in our mindset and our systems. For too long, we've accepted a culture of bureaucratic inertia that stifles innovation. Our talented youth find themselves navigating a maze of administrative hurdles rather than building the future. Ambitious projects get lost in endless committees while opportunities slip through our fingers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our educational system, despite producing brilliant minds, often remains disconnected from the realities of global innovation. We teach our students to seek stability rather than create value. Risk-taking is discouraged, failure is stigmatized, and entrepreneurship is seen as a last resort rather than a first choice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Capital flows freely across our borders, but too often it's flowing outward. While we have the resources, our investment ecosystem remains underdeveloped. Promising startups struggle to find local funding, forcing them to either relocate or abandon their ambitions. We've created a self-fulfilling prophecy where talent leaves because opportunities are limited, and opportunities are limited because talent leaves.
          </p>
